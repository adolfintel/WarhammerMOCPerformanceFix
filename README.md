# Warhammer: Mark of Chaos Performance Fix

[Warhammer: Mark of Chaos](https://www.gog.com/game/warhammer_mark_of_chaos_gold_edition) is a real time strategy game released in 2006.

Despite its age, the game remains CPU bottlenecked to this day due to the fact that it only uses 1 CPU core and there's some leftover debug code that spams millions of system calls to `GetThreadTimes` and `QueryPerformanceCounter`. This causes long load times and irregular performance on Windows and makes the game virtually unplayable on Wine, where these system calls are very slow.

This patch removes the leftover debug code, improving __loading times by 40-50% on Windows__ and by nearly 3000% on Linux (that's not a typo), __game performance will also improve by about 10-15%__ in CPU-bound scenarios (such as large hordes of rats), and __stuttering is reduced__ in general.

## Installation
* Make sure you're using the latest version of the game, it should say Version 2.14 in the menu
* Open the game's installation folder
* Rename `binkw32.dll` to `binkw23.dll`
* Extract `binkw32.dll` to the game's folder
* Run the game
